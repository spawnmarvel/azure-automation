* IaaS
* PaaS 
* DBaaS — Azure automates database updates, provisioning, and backups, which enable you to focus on application development.
* SaaS 

This module focuses on IaaS, PaaS, and database as a service options for Linux.

### Identify Azure IaaS options for Linux deployments

Choosing a Linux distribution

* Licensing/pricing
* Support, Microsoft gives you the option of running almost any Linux image, but the level of support you receive depends on the type of Linux distribution you choose.
* * Microsoft recommends using endorsed distributions for most production workloads because you benefit from the support and collaboration between Microsoft and Linux providers — Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical, and others.
* * Three of the largest Linux vendors — Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu — partner with Microsoft to provide end-to-end support of Linux deployments.
* Virtual networking and network appliances
* Azure Storage
* Choose the appropriate Azure Files tier

When to use Azure IaaS resources for Linux deployments

* Some organizations want to take a hands-on approach with all aspects of their infrastructure, from the choice of virtual machine configurations to storage and network optimization to building custom development environments. For those organizations, IaaS is an appropriate approach.
