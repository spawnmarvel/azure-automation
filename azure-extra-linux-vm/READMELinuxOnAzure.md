## Introduction to Linux on Azure

First, choose the Linux distribution you want based on familiarity, usage, cost, and support requirements.

First, choose the Linux distribution you want based on familiarity, usage, cost, and support requirements.

* IaaS
* PaaS 
* DBaaS — Azure automates database updates, provisioning, and backups, which enable you to focus on application development.
* SaaS 

This module focuses on IaaS, PaaS, and database as a service options for Linux.

### Identify Azure IaaS options for Linux deployments

Choosing a Linux distribution

* Licensing/pricing
* Support, Microsoft gives you the option of running almost any Linux image, but the level of support you receive depends on the type of Linux distribution you choose.
* * Microsoft recommends using endorsed distributions for most production workloads because you benefit from the support and collaboration between Microsoft and Linux providers — Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical, and others.
* * Three of the largest Linux vendors — Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu — partner with Microsoft to provide end-to-end support of Linux deployments.
* Virtual networking and network appliances
* Azure Storage
* Choose the appropriate Azure Files tier

When to use Azure IaaS resources for Linux deployments

* Some organizations want to take a hands-on approach with all aspects of their infrastructure, from the choice of virtual machine configurations to storage and network optimization to building custom development environments. For those organizations, IaaS is an appropriate approach.

Identify Azure PaaS options for Linux deployments

Azure managed platforms allow you to take advantage of the benefits of PaaS while retaining the Linux-based technology foundation you're already familiar with. Some of the popular managed platforms for Linux include:

* Azure App Service
* Azure Functions
* Azure Red Hat OpenShift
* Azure Red Hat OpenShift
* Azure Container Instances

When to use Azure PaaS resources for Linux deployments

* If your goal is to create new applications and services quickly, use PaaS to gain greater agility and reusability by adopting modern development tools and advanced application architectures. 

Identify database-as-a-service options for Linux deployments

A partial list of the fully managed databases available on Azure includes:

* Azure SQL Database
* Azure Database for PostgreSQL
* Azure Database for MySQL
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure Cache for Redis

Identify other Azure tools and services for Linux deployments

Examples of open-source tools

* Prometheus,  On Azure, you don't need to set up and manage a Prometheus server with a database. Instead, use Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus, a component of Azure Monitor Metrics. 
* Terraform, To simplify common IT Ops and DevOps tasks, use Terraform, an open-source declarative coding tool. Terraform works with Bash or Azure PowerShell for Linux.

NOTE: Terraform uses its own Terraform CLI. If you want to use a declarative coding tool more closely integrated with Azure, consider Bicep, which works with Azure CLI and the Azure portal.

* Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Azure, Operate and manage automation with a Red Hat solution that's integrated with native Azure services.
* Azure CLI, Azure Portal, Azure Resource Manager, 


Security tools and capabilities

* Azure provides multilayered security across physical datacenters, infrastructure, and operations in Azure. No matter which Linux distribution you choose, you can protect your workloads by using built-in controls and services in Azure across identity, data, networking, and apps.


Business continuity and disaster recovery

Azure offers an end-to-end backup and disaster recovery solution for Linux that's simple, secure, scalable, and cost-effective — and can be integrated with on-premises data protection solutions.

* Azure Backup
* Azure Site Recovery
* Azure Archive Storage
* Azure Migrate, Use Azure Migrate to simplify migration and optimization when moving Linux workloads to Azure.
