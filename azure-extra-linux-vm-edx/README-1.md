## Module 1: Introduction to Linux

### Module Introduction & Learning Objectives

Introducing Linux and Unix = done

* Unix is a family of operating systems dating from the 1960s.
* Linux was originally developed in the 1980s as a free, open-source alternative to Unix.
* Linux is multi-user, portable, and supports multitasking.
* And Linux is widely used today in mobile devices, supercomputers, data centers, and cloud servers.

Linux Distributions = 

* Linux distros can be differentiated by their user interfaces,
their shell applications, and how the operating system is supported and built.
* The design of a Linux distro is catered toward a specific audience.
* Debian is highly regarded in the server space for its stability, reliability,
and for being open source.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux, an IBM subsidiary, is focused completely on enterprise customers.
* And SUSE Linux Enterprise supports many architectures, such as ARM for Raspberry Pi.

Overview of Linux Architecture =

* The Linux system comprises five distinct layers.
* 1 UI, web browser
* 2 Application, software, shell, apps
* 3 Operating system, users, errros, file management
* 4 Kernel, most vital, lowest level software, bridge between 3 and 5.
* 5 Hardware, physical, CPU, RAM, Storage, screen, usb device

The Linux filesystem is the collection of files on your machine. It includes the files
needed to run the machine and applications as well as your own files containing your
work.
The top level of the filesystem is the root directory, symbolized by a forward slash (/).

* One of the key directories is /bin, which contains user binary files.
* /usr, which contains user programs
* /home, which is your personal working directory
* /boot, which contains your system boot files
* /media, which contains files related to temporary media 

***There are several other directories in the root directory, but you will not need to access them during this course.***

* A Linux system consists of five key layers.
* The user interface is the layer that enables the user to interact with applications using
control devices​.
* Applications enable users to perform certain tasks within the system.
* The operating system runs on top of the Linux kernel and is vital for system health and
stability.
* The kernel is the lowest-level software and enables applications to interact with your
hardware.
* Hardware includes all the physical or electronic components of your PC.
* And the Linux filesystem is a tree-like structure consisting of all directories and
files on the system.
